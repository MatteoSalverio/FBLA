# Description:
This project is a custom website for Chick-fil-A, which has a main focus on application and recruitment. This website was coded entirely by myself using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Usage:
To view the project, visit [https://matteosalverio.github.io/FBLA](https://matteosalverio.github.io/FBLA). This will take you to the home page, and you can look around from there. To view the code, all the files and code for this project are located within this GitHub repository. No external libraries or data are used on this project.

# Permission:
I have gained permission to work on this project from Chick-fil-A because I already work on their website for one of their restaurants, so I was able to ask the owner of that Chick-fil-A if I could create a website for them to use as an FBLA project.
