        <p>For over 25 years, David Neely has been honored to serve the St. Petersburg community as Owner/Operator of
            Chick-fil-A 4th Street North. A third generation native of St. Petersburg, David started his Chick-fil-A
            career
            at the age of 25; one of the youngest to be selected as a franchise owner. With his vision to bring the
            Chick-fil-A free standing concept to St. Petersburg, David opened up his 4th Street restaurant in March
            1999;
            the first in Pinellas County and St. Petersburg.
            <br><br>
            Throughout the years, his hard work and passion for hospitality has awarded him the Chick-fil-A, Inc. Symbol
            of
            Success, Chick-fil-A’s highest honor for an Operator, recognizing those who successfully achieve aggressive
            sales goals.
            <br><br>
            While David’s role serves as the CEO; providing Vision, Clarity and Focus, he prefers to spend his time
            serving
            his team and community through mentorship and leadership development. His goal is to help Team Members
            achieve
            their goals. He is passionate about using his resources to serve the St. Petersburg community, making it a
            wonderful place to live and work.
            <br><br>
            Outside of work, David enjoys reading, classic movies, golf, running and travel. A perfect day for David is
            spending time with his wife Michelle, their three adult children and Bates Neely (The Worlds Best Labrador).
